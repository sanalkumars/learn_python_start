# FastAPI Web Server – Step by Step Guide

This guide walks you through creating a Python web server using FastAPI from scratch. FastAPI is a modern, 
fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To check your version, run `python --version` in your terminal.
- Basic knowledge of Python and command-line interfaces.

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies.

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- `venv` is the name of the virtual environment (you can choose any name, but `venv` or `.venv` is recommended).
- This creates a `venv` folder in your project directory.

## Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the environment to install packages locally.

- **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

After activation, your terminal prompt will show `(venv)`, indicating the environment is active.

## Step 3: Upgrade pip (Optional but Recommended)

Upgrade pip to the latest version for better package management.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Step 4: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn

Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

- **FastAPI**: The web framework for building APIs.
- **Uvicorn**: The ASGI server to run FastAPI applications.

## Step 5: Create the Main Application File

Create a new file named `main.py` in your project directory.

- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  type nul > main.py
  ```

- **macOS / Linux**:
  ```bash
  touch main.py
  ```

## Step 6: Write the FastAPI Application

Open `main.py` in your code editor and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "FastAPI server is running"}
```

This creates a basic FastAPI app with a root endpoint that returns a JSON response.

## Step 7: Run the FastAPI Server

Start the development server with auto-reload enabled.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- `main` refers to the `main.py` file.
- `app` is the FastAPI instance.
- `--reload` enables auto-restart on code changes.

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or `http://localhost:8000`).

## Step 8: Access the Application

Open your web browser and visit:

- **Root endpoint**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – Returns the JSON message.
- **Interactive API docs**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) – Powered by Swagger UI for testing endpoints.

## Step 9: Stop the Server

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.

## Step 10: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When done, deactivate the environment.

```bash
deactivate
```

Your terminal prompt will return to normal.

## Project Structure

After following these steps, your project should look like this:

```
project/
├── venv/              # Virtual environment (ignore in version control)
├── main.py            # Your FastAPI application
└── README.md          # This guide (or project documentation)
```

## Additional Tips

- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues, ensure Python and pip are correctly installed. Check for typos in commands.
- **Next Steps**: Explore FastAPI documentation at [fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for advanced features like request validation, authentication, and database integration.
- **Version Control**: Add `venv/` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing the virtual environment.

Happy coding! 🚀
